# The CCA
#### The CCA project allows the community to contribute to the creation of NFT art. The bigger the community, the better is the art! People can choose from 9 different colors, which will be inculcated in the upcoming NFT. After all, this project is all about collaboration, which helps build art, piece by piece.
The project website is made using Wix, which helps in data collection. The data collected is then converted into an image by a python script.
